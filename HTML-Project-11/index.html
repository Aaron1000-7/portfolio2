          <strong>Volunteer Experience</strong>
          <h3>Open Heart Kitchen</h3>
          <h4>2016-2019</h4>
          <p>Open Heart Kitchen is a volunteer service that helps the community with free food services. It was a very fun experience as helping people with smiles and seeing them happy to eat food or take boxes to feed their family. All of them are very thankful for this service as it is cheap, sanitary, and helps a lot of people that are in a financial crisis. It really reflects how blessed we are to be able to have many material possessions while many others have just barely enough to provide for their families.</p>

          <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
          <h4>CSP</h4>
          <p>I was in a group of two where we had to create a story or game in a programming website called Scratch. With some brainstorming along with influence of playing mobile games in the past, we created a car game. In the start of the game, the player robs a bank and gets inside a getaway car in which the player has to maneuver the car away from obstacles on the side of the road as well as the middle of the road with an additional police car ready to capture at any moment. </p>

          <strong>Leadership Experience</strong>
          <h3>Valley Community Organization</h3>
          <h4>2016-2020</h4>
          <p>I am proud to say that I have successfully worked with children at and under the age of five. They are very hard to cope with and change their mind about the easiest things, but I have found a way to lead them in a way that compromises between us to help do what we want to do. They may not comprehend what we understand so we have to use the best of our abilities to make them follow.</p>

          <p>I like to use my spare time to draw. I do art to strengthen my observational skills. Whenever I draw something, such as a architecture, I like to use my creativity to figure out what will make it stand out more than other drawings.    </p>
