          <font color="white"><p>Hello, my name is Aaron and I was born in San Jose California. I attended Valley Christian Elementary which was a very tough private school as I would always finish my homework late at night which is a pretty big deal when you are not even in middle school yet. I struggled and I was not always the brightest student, but I had one main accomplishment that I've been quite proud of.</p>
          <p>I have always liked the idea of creating or building so my parents made me join a robotics program that was located in a high school where people would tinker with robots to complete a common goal. There were over thirty students in the class and each individual had to modify a robot that would drive itself from one corner of a customly built soccer set and move itself to a position where it would kick a given toy soccer ball into a goal without knocking down any of the 14 figurines that were loosely placed on the set. To cut this part of my story short, I indisputably won first place out of the thirty or so people there.</p> 
          <p>One of my true passions is to create a business. The way I will achieve it is by studying hard in college as well as observing the world. You may be confused about observing the world, but what I mean is to find out what is missing in our lives. What is there that is a common challenge that can be improved for the better? This is my career choice because I want to have the ability to change something in someone's life.</p>
          
          <p>I really do hope to one day achieve my greatest goal. Thank you!</p></font>
