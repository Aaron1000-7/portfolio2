    <p><strong>September 11, 2019</strong></p>
    <p>We were instructed to create a story or game in a programming website called Scratch. With some brainstorming along with influences of playing mobile and computer games in the past, we created a car game. We had many struggles in the beginning such as creating the illusion that the car is moving along the road. I figured it out by animating the road by lengthening a picture of a road and repeating it to make it move. After we got the most mind-boggling part finished, we started to create moving obstacles that the player would have to dodge. Nothing stood out to be difficult as we finished the first level since we just had to replicate it for the last four levels.</p>
    <p>In the start of the game, the player robs a bank and gets inside a getaway car in which the player has to maneuver the car away from obstacles on the side of the road as well as the middle of the road with an additional police car ready to capture at any moment.</p>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <p>1) Use the arrow keys to move the car up, down, left, right.</p>
    <p>2) Do not crash into objects on the side of the road as well as moving objects in the middle of the road.</p>
    <p>3) Try not to get captured!</p>

    <p><strong><u>App Inventor Project (Computer Science Principles)</u></strong></p>
    <p><strong>October 9, 2019</strong></p>
    <p>We were instructed to create a working app on the ipad with the help of App Inventor programming tools. My partner and I chose to create an app where you can draw/plot dots, cubes, and create straight lines with a variety of colors. By touching the screen, you can add a cube or a circle and control the size of them. If you drag your finger across the screen, you have the ability to just draw or draw a straight line. The color requires the user to type the hexadecimal in order to get the color you want. After picking the color, the app lets you name the color and save it so you don't have to retype it the next time. you need it</p>
